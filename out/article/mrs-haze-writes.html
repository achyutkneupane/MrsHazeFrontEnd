Welcome to a part of me: One that stays hidden mostly coz\u0026rsquo; it lives rent-free in my head. Isn\u0026rsquo;t that where the most intimate versions of us are found? You could be lying to the whole world, but you know who you are. And you know who you\u0026rsquo;re not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo yeah... overthinking! My specialty!

Coz\u0026rsquo; words live on, don\u0026rsquo;t they? This is a space for me to be me. To put in paper these fleeting emotions and watch them fly by, like clouds on a sunset. To see me for who I am, where I am, and where I intend to go. To be. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","description":"I am Mrs. Haze, aka Subani Moktan, one and the same but not really.
